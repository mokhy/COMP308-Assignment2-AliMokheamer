                      This is an ASP.NET Web application that I have developed for an academic
                      project. I had the role of a full-stack developer working with HTML, CSS,
                      BootStrap, C#, and MSSQL. The outcome of this Web application was making
                      it possible to add different genres of books to the library's collection
                      and search and look at top books books based on what other users have
                      added.

                      working with Node.JS and MongoDB. The outcome of this Web application was
                      providing information on outdoor activities (whomever provides it in a
                      specific geographical location) so it will be easier for whoever is
                      interested in seeking to plan to take part in an outdoor activity to do
                      so.

                      This is a Java EE based Web application that I have developed for an
                      academic project. I had the role of a full-stack developer working with
                      JSP, Servlets, and JPA using MYSQL. The outcome of this Web application
                      was to provide information on what an Asian Cuisine Restaurant offers
                      based on food items and other special dishes. This allowed the user to
                      order the given items and have their order either picked up at the
                      restaurant or delivered to them.
